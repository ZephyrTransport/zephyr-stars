# Zephyr Stars

These projects have been "starred" multiple times by the 
members of the [Zephyr Foundation](https://zephyrtransport.org).
Stars mean different things to different people, from "this is a 
useful tool for work" to "I want to be able to find this again" 
to "my buddy made a fundraising website".  But it is expected 
that GitHub projects high on this list (i.e. starred by a large 
number of analytic transportation professionals) will tend to be 
in the first category.

## Contributing

Zephyr members are invited to contribute in two ways:

1. If you’re already included on our list, go out and put GitHub stars on projects you 
   use or like.  
2. You can propose additions to the list of known users, either by 
   adding yourself, or by adding respected colleagues working in our industry.  You can do 
   so by making a 
   [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
   on the [known-users.yml](https://github.com/ZephyrTransport/zephyr-stars/blob/master/known-users.yml) file in the
   [Zephyr Stars repository](https://github.com/ZephyrTransport/zephyr-stars).
   If you’re not familiar with Git, this is your opportunity 
   to learn a bit how to use it.  For a simple repository update like this, you can do it 
   entirely on [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) and you don’t even need to download or 
   install anything (although you’ll certainly want to eventually if you want to really 
   use Git).
